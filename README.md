hey, i just want SOME way in some of my profiles to.. show what I feel, because... I want to explain my feelings, even if it is to... basically the void, I still want it out there. 
I love you, Ellias. I love you so much, that... its hard to comprehend how much, ive realized how i feel about you a 2nd time, somehow. I've also grown. im not just saying that, I really have, and realized how frustrating I was for the longest time. 
I am not done growing either, I will continue to. and... I want to be in your life. I want to do nice things for you, for the one I love more than anything. I want to do what... you say because you told me to, and I don't want to annoy you anymore. 
But... I also really want to try to help you heal, and I am trying to figure out actions that I can take to... prove that I am more mature, and that I wont hurt you. and... my old toxic behaviors. I don't care what you think of this, or if you believe me or not, but... its up to you. I cant force you to heal, i cant force you to take me back, I can only try to present myself as I am now, and not how I was before. I am sincerely sorry for my lack of self control in the past. I am sorry. not just because it made... things worse for me, but because of how frustrating it had to be to you. I would like some way to show you how I am now. I would, but... I'm not gonna reach out, atleast for now. I sincerely love you. I want to treat you better and do nice things for you because of the way that I feel about you, and not that I regret how I treated you before. I do regret it, but it's not why I want to do better. 



I love you. and I always will. you will forever be the one I love. I know we are meant for eachother, I had issues. I realize that now, and now I have fixed/am fixing them, and I am actually proud of the progress I have made. I am proud OF MYSELF for my own progress, and I hope that you would be too, and are... if you somehow find this. or check this, i doubt you will. but... I love you. and theres nothing you could do to stop me from feeling the way I do.
I am sorry for my refusal to help myself for me for the longest time. I am sorry for how childish and immature I acted. I am sorry for being so delusional about my own progress, but now I have actions to prove that I am... mature, and I can see those actions and be proud of my ownself for them. I want you to be proud too, because I want us to work out. more than anything in this life, I want us to work out. I am still trying to grow as a person, but... I have made... insane progress, and I am so.. proud of myself for it.
and again, i want you to be as well.
I love you. there is not a single thing you could do to change that. I know how I feel. and I am sorry for the way that I was, and I am sorry for my delusion and my failures.



I want to help you heal from my mistakes. because thats not what I do anymore. I want to help the one I love, I want to show the one I love how much they mean, how much they are worth how much they deserve to be loved and... I want to be trusted. I want to help you heal, i want to be able to be trusted again, because I can earn forgiveness... I just need to be able to show you.. my behavior.. I love you. I love you so so much its hard to grasp my own.. wants around it. I .... 


I hope you see this and I hope that we can talk. I want to show you action I want to, I am trying to figure out what to do, because... I ... I dont know what to do.. I am thinking about it, but I dont want to reach out and annoy you... and so im... stuck in a gray zone... And.. I hope that you can pull me out of it, so that I can pull you out of the hurt I caused in the past.

There is more I could say. but... its.. just going to be other thoughts essentially, and they are so.. sporatic that i cant even really put them down in a way that i wont... reiterate them bc.. idk what ive said really? if that makes sense??? idk... im ranting now.
