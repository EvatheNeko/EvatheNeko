I am trying to stay true to who I am. 
I can't hope anymore though. 
I dont have the will to continue anymore. 
I am scared, I am hurt. 
I am too scared to try anymore. 
I cant do this without you. 
I genuinely cant, El. 

I truly, truly can not without you.

I can't be me. 
I can't be a person without you. 
I cant do what ive learned without you. 
If you were a learning experience, then... 
Then its useless, because i cant do it for anyone else but you. 
I cant. 
I never will be able to.
I am hurt. 
I am broken. 
I can not move on, I can not trust anyone else.

All i want is to be with you. 
All i want is to be happy. 
I can't try to chase you anymore. 
please come back.
Please. PLEASE.
I can't... i cant do this without you. 
I cant be me without you. 
PLEASE, please please. I Am only saying all of this here, because of how unlikely it is for you to find this...
But.. this is a cry for help, I need you. No one else, You. 
Nothing can change it, not without actually fucking destroying myself, destroying my whole personality, my whole... reality. without breaking myself entirely. Please... Please... Please.....
