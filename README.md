If you read this Ellias... just know that... you are... amazing. 
If you read this, please believe me when I say that I can give you what you needed for so long. That I am not the same as I was before, I am more mature. I am still clingy, and somewhat desperate, that I have to be honest about.
What I know is that I can do this. I am enough for you. I can give you what you pleaded for so long. 
I am able to do it. just let me do it. let me try for you. let us try. a relationship is a give and take... let me give. I know I can do it.
I've realized things. I've realized a lot. just let me do it. give me a chance to be enough, I know you said it's too late. but I am here now. 
I am here now, for you, and I can do it. let me prove it. give me 2 weeks. give me 2 weeks and I will prove to you that I can do this. for both of us. 
that I can be able to suppport you, give you the love you deserve, the affection you deserve, the attention you deserve, and have deserved for so, so so so long
You said it's too late.
It's not too late, it's never too late. I am here now. Let me prove it. thats all i beg. just let me prove through actions that I can do this. for you. 
for no one else, but you. stop being pessimistic. i am here now. just believe me. thats all I want. trust me, trust me one more time that I can do this. 
I can do this. you just have to let me. 
I'm not trying to be manipulative. I just want to tell you how I feel, what I think i can do. I am... very sure in how I feel. 
Just let me have 1 more chance, and I will be better. I wont be toxic, not like I was before, not like I was for the last 3 and a half years. I have grown as a person. I am... sure. 
all you have to do... is trust me. just this once. trust me one more time, trust me in how I can do this. trust me. please. 
Just. internalize it, if you ever read this. just. trust. me.
I want to put in the effort that you did for so long. I want to support you, like I should have been for 3 years, how I should've loved you more, for 3 years. I can do it.
I am not the same toxic idiot i was before. i am angry at myself, and I am speaking from my heart here. Im not revising this at all. just. believe me. please. 
give me 2 weeks and i will prove through actions that i can work like a fucntional human being. that we are in the same stage of life, that i can make a miracle happen. 
I promise. I will never ever neglect you again. never hurt you. I still need work with how I deal with some things, But if you just let me have 2 weeks, from 1/2/2026...
Let me prove to you that I am enough for you. all you have to do... is trust me.
